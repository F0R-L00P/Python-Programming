# Python-Programming
From Intern to Director, these are common Python Programming skills that everyone will benefit from!


### Always remember coding best practices. Quality code boils down to:

1. Write Short Units of Code - Short units are easier to understand.
2. Write Simple Units of Code - Simple units are easier to test.
3. Write Code Once - Duplicated code means duplicated bugs and duplicating changes.
4. Keep Unit Interfaces Small - Units with small interfaces are easier to reuse.
5. Separate Concerns in Modules - Modules with a single responsibility are easier to change.
6. Couple Architecture Components Loosely - Independent components can be maintained in isolation.
7. Keep Architecture Components Balanced - A balanced architecture makes it easier to find your way.
8. Keep Your Codebase Small - A small codebase requires less effort to maintain.
9. Automate Tests - Automated tests are repeatable, and help to prevent bugs.
10. Write Clean Code - “Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.”
