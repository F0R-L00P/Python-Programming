# Logging

Logging allows you to know what has happened to your program.

Assume if a user executes your program and is unable to run it; you follow the exact steps and get no errors!

These problems are extremely hard to diagnose without being able to trace back. therefore, if you have a record (log file) with enough info you can read and eventually resolve the issue.
