# Logging

Logging allows you to know what has happened to your program. Imagine this situation. You have a web application or redistributable app. 

If a user executes your program and unable to run it, you follow the exact steps and get no error!

These problems are very hard to diagnose. If you have a record, a log file, with enough info you can just read what happened.
